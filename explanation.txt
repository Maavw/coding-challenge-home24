How I solved the task:

To solve this task I started to choose the programming language PHP because I've already seen it in the past and it is easy to start with.
First, I figured out that I need a program wich can compare all letters from the input with the alphabet to determine if it is a pangram or not.
Therefore I created a template wich contains the alphabet to compare against the input, wich is separated in single characters. I found a function from PHP on the web, wich compares the values of two arrays and returns the missing letters.
If there are no missing letters the output should show that the input is a pangram.
